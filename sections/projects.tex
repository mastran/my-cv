\cventry{}{Fault Tolerant Key Value Store}{}{}{}
  {A distributed dictionary made fault-tolerant using Raft protocol. Requires $2f+1$ servers to tolerate \textit{f} crash failures in the system.}
\cventry{}{AI-Pollo: Mixed Reality Theatre}{}{}{}
  {A HoloLens application that dynamically anchors holograms to different world positions based on an external control application. Multiple hololens can view same shared environment.}
\cventry{}{FPGA Implementation of Stereo Vision}{}{}{}
  {Image disparity computed with corelation between two imags from identical cameras and disparity map dispalyed in a monitor. Spartan 3A DSP borad and VHDL languge used to program the system}
\cventry{}{USB based oscilloscope}{}{}{}
  {USB oscilloscope using ADC module in Atmega8. GUI Interface made in C++ to view signals.}
% \cventry{}{PIC Programmer}{}{}{}
%   {USB Programmer to program PIC16F/18F series mcus using Atmega8}
